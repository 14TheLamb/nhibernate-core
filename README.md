Welcome to NHibernate!
======================

[NHibernate](http://www.nhforge.org) is a mature, open source object-relational mapper for the .NET 
framework. It is actively developed, fully featured and used in thousands of successful projects.

The NHibernate community website - <http://www.nhforge.org> - has a range of resources to help you get started,
including [wikis](http://nhforge.org/wikis), [blogs](http://nhforge.org/blogs/nhibernate) and 
[reference documentation](http://nhforge.org/doc/nh/en/index.html).

Latest Version
--------------

The quickest way to get the latest release of NHibernate is to add it to your project using 
NuGet (<http://nuget.org/List/Packages/NHibernate>).

Alternatively binaries are available from SourceForge at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/nhibernate>.

You are encouraged to review the release notes (releasenotes.txt), particularly when upgrading to a 
later version. The release notes will generally document any breaking changes.

Community Forums
----------------

There are two official NHibernate community forums:

* [NHibernate Users](http://groups.google.com/group/nhusers) - for NHibernate users 
* [NHibernate Development](http://groups.google.com/group/nhibernate-development) - for NHibernate developers

Bug Reports
-----------

If you find any bugs, please report them using the [JIRA bug tracker](http://nhibernate.jira.org). A
test-case that demonstrates the issue is usually required. Instructions on providing a test-case
can be found [here](http://nhforge.org/blogs/nhibernate/archive/2008/10/04/the-best-way-to-solve-nhibernate-bugs-submit-good-unit-test.aspx).
